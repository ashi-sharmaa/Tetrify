# ARES HackTX Project
 
A project aimed at making Tetris more accessible by leveraging computer vision, specifically media
pipe. Players can control the movement of the blocks using hand position rather than precise
keyboard inputs. 

Original Tetris code forked from ibrahimAtespare. Check it out here: https://github.com/ibrahimAtespare/tetris-python

Made for HackTX 2024.
